        A Dream <sup>&reg;</sup> </h1>

    <p align="center">
        In vision of the dark night <br>
        I have dreamed of joy departed- <br>
        But a waking dram of life and light <br>
        Hath left me broken-hearted <br>
    </p>

    <p align="center">
        Ah! What is not a dream by day <br>
        To him whose eyes are cast <br>
        On things around him with a ray <br>
        Turned back upon the past? <br>
    </p>

    <p align="center">
        That holy dream- that holy dream, <br>
        While all the world were chiding, <br>
        Hath cheered me as a lovely beam <br>
        A lonely spirit guiding. <br>
    </p>

    <p align="center">
        What though that light, thro' storm and night, <br>
        So trembled from afar- <br>
        What could there be more purely bright <br>
        In truth's day-star? <br>
